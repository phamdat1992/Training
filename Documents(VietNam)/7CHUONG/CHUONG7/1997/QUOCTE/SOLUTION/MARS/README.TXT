Programme: Mars.exe
Authors: Kevin Dennis and Ashton Mason
Language: C/C++
Algorithm:

The programme reads the terrain into an array.
A binary tree is then created for all possible
  movements from the start to the end.
Thus.... Only complete paths can be seen as the
  tree does not continue past rough terrain.
Therefore.... The paths are evaluated to see which
  sample the most times, and the larges sum of the 
  paths according to how many MEV's there are, is
  chosen and these paths are thenused as output.
